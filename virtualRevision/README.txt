This plugin makes possible for NVDA users to review a Window content in a text box, similar to window virtualization of JAWS for Windows. Note, however, that this is just a convenience for users and *do not* replace NVDA's excelent flat review and object navigation support.

== Installation ==

Copy the virtualRevision folder next to this README file to your globalPlugins folder. For installed copies this folder is on

%APPDATA%\nvda\globalPlugins

and for portable copies it is on

<path-to-nvda>\userConfig\globalPlugins

== Usage ==

Press nvda+control+w to open the virtual revision Window. Then simply navigate the shown textbox as you do in any other text content.
