= systrayList NVDA Plugin =

Version: 1.2
Authors: Rui Fontes and Rui Batista

This plugin makes possible to read and activate icons on the system tray within a list box for easy access to those items. With the plugin installed press NVDA+f11 for this dialog to pop-up.

Note that you can access the windows sysstem tray in any screenreader software using the windows+b shortcut key. This plugin is only useful to make the transition from JAWS for Windows smoother and to avoid some tooltips that may pop-up when cycling through the system tray with the windows keyboard means.

== Installation ==

Copy the systrayList folder to your globalPlugins folder on the NVDA configuration directory. You can access this folder by two means:

On an installed copy go to the windows run dialog (windows+r) and type 
%APPDATA%\nvda\globalPlugins
Followed by  the enter key.

On a NVDA portable copy please find the userConfig\gobalPlugins directory under the root NVDA directory.
